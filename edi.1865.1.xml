    <abstract>
      <para>
    The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) collects data on adult
    salmonids on Clear Creek. Data are collected annually via snorkel
    surveys and a video weir. Video camera systems collect data on
    upstream passage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from December –
    August. Data from this monitoring are used to estimate adult
    escapement (upstream passage) abundance and timing, spawner
    abundance, and other important metrics for adult salmonids in the
    watershed. These data will also be used to inform the development of
    a juvenile production estimate (JPE) for spring-run Chinook salmon
    (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Sacramento River Watershed.

      The Clear Creek video monitoring system has been in operation near
      the mouth of Clear Creek since 2012 and is operated December
      through August. Fish are funneled through a resistance board weir
      where one overhead camera and three underwater cameras record fish
      passage upstream. Footage is viewed and entered into MS excel
      spreadsheets at the end of each monitoring season. When fish
      counts are unclear from the footage, it is reviewed by up to three
      experts.
    </para>
            <para>
      Video data are focused on upstream counting of fish passage
      through the resistance board weir. Additional information
      describing fish biology is collected by the Clear Creek monitoring
      program: date, time, count, run, adipose fin clip status, sex,
      passage direction, jack size, and spawning condition. Viewing
      condition is collected less consistently (75% NAs). Run assignment
      of Chinook Salmon is recorded based on date of passage
      observation. Some limitations of the video system and passage
      estimates based on the video system include identification
      challenges because of camera placement, turbidity visibility
      challenges, run determination by date inaccuracies, video outages
      in high flow years, and GAM model performance when there are low
      counts or uneven daily counts.

      Snorkel surveys also evaluate responses of spring Chinook Salmon

      spawning.

      at river mile 0.1 (40.504836N latitude, -122.369693W longitude)
      near the confluence with the Sacramento River.
    </para>
            <para><emphasis>Times of operation:</emphasis> Surveys are conducted
      before and after each pulse flow and at the end of August to
      generate a population index of returning adults (August Index).
    </para>
            <para><emphasis>Consistency</emphasis>: From 1999-2005, snorkel surveys
      were carried out monthly from April through August to determine
      spring Chinook Salmon migration timing, evaluate levels of
      pre-spawn mortality, spatiotemporal distribution, and presence of
      winter Chinook Salmon in Clear Creek. In 2006, survey frequency
      was reduced to only June and August after it was established that
      winter Chinook Salmon were not spawning in Clear Creek and
      established migration timing and distribution of spring Chinook
      Salmon. Pulse flow releases from Whiskeytown Dam began in 2010,
      thus survey frequency was increased to include surveys before and
      after each pulse flow event. External environmental factors
      limited survey frequency in some years therefore all years within
      the dataset are not directly comparable with other years. Please
      contact staff associated with this package for more information.

      Variables collected consistently on Clear Creek include date,
      latitude, longitude, reach, year, method, and run. Species is
      collected less consistently (57% NAs). Sample reaches are surveyed
      multiple times per season to determine redd decomposition rate.
      Redd data is considered an accurate count of the spawning
      population in years where 3 or more surveys are conducting during
      the survey year. Redd data most accurately counts total spawning
      population in years with fewer redds and is a less reliable
      measure in years with large spawning populations. Redds are
      assigned a unique redd ID upon observation. If a redd is observed
      more than once, it may be assigned an age, and that redd ID may
      have multiple observations in a table. There is a partial natural
      barrier to fall and late-fall Chinook Salmon passage on Clear
      Creek. A picket weir is temporarily installed upstream of the
      barrier to prevent any fall Chinook Salmon from mixing with spring
      Chinook Salmon. Any Chinook redds observed above this picket weir
      are considered spring Chinook Salmon. Methods for measuring
      substrate size has varied over the years and for this package,
      substrate class was standardized using the Wentworth scale,
      created by W.C. Krumbein. This scale is what is commonly used in
      the United States. When the size range fell into two categories,
      they were rounded down. The scale, in descending size order, is
      boulder (&gt;256mm), cobble (64-256mm), very coarse gravel
      (32-64mm), coarse gravel (16-32mm), medium gravel (8-16mm), fine
      gravel (4-8mm), very fine gravel (2-4mm), very coarse sand
      (1-2mm), coarse sand (0.5-1mm), medium sand (0.25-0.5mm), fine
      sand – clay (&lt;0.25mm).
